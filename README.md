# Particle-Swarm-Optimization of Fuzzy Controller
Particle swarm optimization of an active suspension system modelled by a simulink diagram in matlab. The active suspension system comprises of a fuzzy controller. 
Details of files:
   1. Psom.m: Optimizes the three parameters (A,B,C) of the active suspension system according to particle swarm optimization                and displays the final result along with a plot of the fitness function over iterations. 
   2. Suspension.fis: Defines the fuzzy controller.
   3. parameters.m: Final optimal values of the controller.
   4. test.m: Runs simulink model.
